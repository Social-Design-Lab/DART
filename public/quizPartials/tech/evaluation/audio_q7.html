            <li class="target" data-timecode="00:08">Target: That’s strange; I just bought this computer. What do I need to do?</li>
            <li class="scammer" data-timecode="00:12">Scammer: Yes, unfortunately, many new computers can have pre-existing security issues. Don’t worry, we can fix this. We offer a special security package that will protect your computer and personal data. It’s a one-time fee of $299.99 for complete protection.</li>
            <li class="target" data-timecode="00:29">Target: $299.99? That sounds expensive. Are you sure this is necessary?</li>
            <li class="scammer" data-timecode="00:37">Scammer: Absolutely. If these issues aren’t resolved immediately, you risk losing all your data and having your personal information compromised. We will provide round-the-clock support and ensure your computer is fully secured. I just need your credit card information to process this.</li>
