            <li class="speaker1 current" data-timecode="00:00">Scammer: Can you please provide cash or make a wire transfer?</li>
            <li class="speaker2" data-timecode="00:04">Grandma: Yes, but it is a lot of money, I need to withdraw money from my bank.</li>
            <li class="speaker1" data-timecode="00:11">Scammer: Great! One more thing to keep in mind: we want to keep Alex's record clear. Any publicity could harm his case, so please don’t tell anyone about this. You wouldn’t want him to have a criminal record, right? Especially when you withdraw the money, the banker may ask why you are withdrawing it. Please keep it confidential and simply say it's for a personal matter. We want to avoid any unnecessary attention that could impact Alex's case.</li>
            <li class="speaker2" data-timecode="00:37">Grandma: Okay, okay. Where do I send the money?</li>
            <li class="speaker1" data-timecode="00:40">Scammer: You can mail it to us, or we can arrange for our courier service to pick up the money from you. We just want to expedite the process so we can get Alex out sooner.</li>
            <li class="speaker2" data-timecode="00:49">Grandma: oh, okay. Then please send the courier, I will give cash. It would be the easiest for both of us.</li>
            <li class="speaker1" data-timecode="00:58">Scammer: Great, please call me at this number once you get the money, I will send our courier to you. And, can you give me your home address?</li>
