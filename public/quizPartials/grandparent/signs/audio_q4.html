            <li class="speaker1" data-timecode="00:14"> Scammer: Okay good. When you go to Walmart they will not accept checks, credit cards, or money orders. You will need cash or a debit card. They are going to charge you $2,200 and a fee of about $40. When you go to Walmart it is very simple, you go to customer service and you are going to tell them that you want to send a Walmart Money Transfer.</li>
