        <strong>Scammer (male voice): </strong>I need to get a new phone ASAP, Grandma. I'm missing out on important calls and emails and I am worried I might lose my job.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>I understand, dear. How much do you need for a new phone?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Scammer: </strong>I found a great deal for one for $500, Grandma. But, they only have one left…I need you to send the money to me now so it doesn’t get sold out.

        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>Alright, alright, I'll do it right away. Just hold on.
