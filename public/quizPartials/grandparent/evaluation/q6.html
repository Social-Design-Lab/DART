        <strong>Grandparent (female voice): </strong>Don't worry, I'll help you. What do I need to do?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Scammer: </strong>Grandma, I need you to send the money quickly. Can you do it through cryptocurrency?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>Cryptocurrency? I'm not familiar with that.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Scammer: </strong> It's easy, Grandma. You just need to download an app called "CryptoWallet" on your phone. Once you have it, I'll give you my wallet address, and you can send the money directly to me. It's fast and secure.
