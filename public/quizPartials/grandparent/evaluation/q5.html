        <strong>Scammer (fake grandchild): </strong>Grandma, I need your help. (frantic, scared voice) I was driving and suddenly there was a woman stopped in front of me. She’s pregnant, and I hit her, and they’re going to take me to jail, and Grandma, please don’t call my mom and dad, because I don’t want them to know.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>Brandon, it doesn’t sound like you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Scammer: </strong>Oh, I have a cold, Grandma. Grandma, a friend of mine has an attorney that we can use and that we can do something about me going to jail. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>Yes, of course.
