        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>Yes, yes, I'll do it right away. Just hold on. Everything will be okay, sweetheart. Should I tell your parents?

        <strong>Scammer: </strong>No, no, please don't tell them yet, Grandpa. They'll only worry, and I don't want them to stress out more than they already are. Let's keep this between us for now, okay?

        <strong>Grandparent: </strong>Okay, I understand, dear. I won't say anything. Just focus on getting better.
