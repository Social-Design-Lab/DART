    "choices": {
      "a": {
        "text": "A. Propose marriage → Wedding planning → Steal Honeymoon funds",
        "explanation": "This option does not accurately reflect the scam's progression as described in the video. There is no mention of marriage proposals, wedding planning, or honeymoon funds in the narrative. The scam focused on building a relationship and then exploiting it for financial gain."
      },
      "b": {
        "text": "B. Fake profile → Contact & Groom → Money or favor request",
        "explanation": "This correctly outlines the phases. In the video, the scam began with \"Christopher\" creating an alluring fake profile, designed to attract Sophia. He then invested time in developing a bond with Sophia. Lastly, after gaining Sophia's trust, he fabricated a failed business deal requesting Sophia to give him $10,000."
      },
      "c": {
        "text": "C. Fake profile → Contact & Groom → Ghost",
        "explanation": "In scams like the one experienced by Sophia, scammers usually do not ghost or cease communication with their victims until after they have successfully solicited money or received what they wanted."

In the video, the scam began with Sophia finding \"Christopher's\" alluring <strong>fake profile</strong>. \"Christopher\" then invested time into <strong>contacting and grooming</strong> Sophia to develop a bond.
