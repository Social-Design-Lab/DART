        "text": "A. Check their profile information",
        "explanation": "A is correct because when you search someone’s profile information, it may reveal clues showing that their account is fraudulent. It could also show that they have used the same aspects of their profile in various ways, strongly indicating that the profile is a scam."
      },
      "1": {
        "text": "B. Digitally transfer them money",
        "explanation": "B is incorrect because digitally sending money to someone you have not met in-person is never a wise decision, especially if you notice suspicious behavior from the profile."
      },
      "2": {
        "text": "C. Block them",
        "explanation": "C is correct because blocking a profile after noticing bad signs is a crucial step in protecting yourself. Although it can be tempting to continue talking to them or to give them the benefit of the doubt, listen to the warning signs!"
      },
      "3": {
        "text": "D. Share their profile with your friends and family",
        "explanation": "D is correct because sharing someone’s profile with your loved ones can both get you a non-biased perspective on the relationship, but also confirm that they are not speaking with or attempting to scam other people in your circle because it is common for scammers to circulate amongst familiar groups of people."
      },
      "4": {
        "text": "E. Verify the person's identity through additional online searches or reverse image searches.",
        "explanation": "E is correct because verifying the person's identity through additional searches can help confirm if they are using a fake identity or stolen photos."
