        "text": "A. Feel happy and provide your grandchild's name, assuming they want you to guess it.",
        "explanation": "Choice A is incorrect. It's understandable to feel happy when receiving a call from a grandchild. However, if they address you generically, it's safer to have them state their name first. Given the prevalence of grandparent scams, instruct your grandchildren to proactively identify themselves when calling, instead of prompting you to guess their name. Therefore, if someone asks you to guess their identity, it should raise an alert."

Even with plenty of your personal information, it is highly unlikely the scammers would know your secret word or the answers to a specific question known only to your grandchild. If you don’t have one yet, create one now."

Contacting the police department directly is a reliable method."
