            "text": "A. Requests remote access to your device",
            "explanation": "Choice A is correct. Scammers frequently request remote access to your computer, claiming they need to check for security issues or viruses. They may say that you lack the skills to resolve these issues and offer to take care of it for you. Once granted access, they can view all your files, install malware, and maintain future control over your device for malicious purposes."

            "text": "B. Pop-up claims your computer is infected with a virus.",
            "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Fake pop-up warnings aim to scare and mislead you into believing your device is compromised, so that you will call the number provided for \"tech support.\" However, this \"tech support\" is actually provided by the scammers. Once you call, they will try to scam you, often by requesting remote access to your computer or charging fees for unnecessary services."

          "text": "C. Instructs you to visit an authorized service center or retail store for device repair or support.",
          "explanation": "Choice C is incorrect. Legitimate tech support providers typically do not ask for remote access, generate pop-up warnings, make unsolicited claims about securing purchases, or instruct you to download unverified apps. Reputable companies, like Microsoft, will have you follow a list of steps to secure your computer. Often, these are point by point instructions listed on Microsoft's support pages. Requesting that the customer takes the device to an official service location is also a standard practice."

          "text": "D. Asks you to download a security software that allegedly locates viruses on your computer.",
          "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Legitimate tech support would not instruct you to download unfamiliar programs, especially unprompted. However, scammers do this to trick you into installing malware that grants them access to your system and data. By getting you to run their malicious programs under the guise of security software, they can take full control of your device."

The safe approach is to ignore the email and directly check your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.</p>",
