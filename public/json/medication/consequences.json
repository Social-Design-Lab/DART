          "text": "B. You might not receive the product you paid for.",
          "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Scammers often take upfront payment and never deliver the product. In this case, it’s likely the advertised product never even existed; the goal was simply to collect money."

          "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Taking multiple medications or supplements at once can be risky. Their ingredients might interact in ways that damage your health. Counterfeit medicines are even more dangerous because they often don't list all their ingredients on the package."
