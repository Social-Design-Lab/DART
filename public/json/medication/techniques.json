        "text": "A. By using terms like 'FDA registered' or 'FDA certified'",
        "explanation": "Choice A is correct. Scammers often use FDA regulatory terms like 'FDA registered' or 'FDA certified' to make products seem official and legitimate. However, these terms do not denote FDA approval nor guarantee the safety, efficacy, and quality of the product."
      },
      "1": {
        "text": "B. By providing clinical trial data or third-party testing results",
        "explanation": "Choice B is incorrect. Scammers rarely provide genuine clinical evidence to support their claims. They may make claims that their product is 'clinically tested' or 'clinically proven,' even when this is not true. Even if they do provide some evidence, it is usually fake or altered."
      },
      "2": {
        "text": "C. By offering free consultation with state-licensed physicians or pharmacists",
        "explanation": "Choice C is incorrect. Although scammers may offer free consultations, itâ€™s likely that these individuals are not actually licensed to give legitimate medical advice."

      "3": {
        "text": "D. By featuring fake testimonials from supposed past buyers or healthcare providers",

      "1": {
        "text": "B. The claim of 'zero side effects' is unrealistic and unverifiable",
        "explanation": "Choice B is correct. It is unrealistic to guarantee that any supplement will have no side effects for everyone, as individual reactions to supplements can vary."
      },
      "2": {
        "text": "C. The term 'plant-based' is used to imply the product is inherently safer",
        "explanation": "Choice C is correct. While plant-based supplements might be perceived as safer, they are not necessarily safer than synthetic ones. Scammers often use this perception to create a false sense of security."

        "text": "D. The advertisement makes an unrealistic promise of improved health and vitality for everyone.",

    "choices": {
      "0": {
        "text": "A. By including real effective ingredients that actually work",
        "explanation": "Choice A is incorrect. Products used in medication scams rarely contain ingredients that provide real benefits. Instead, scammers make deceptive claims and exaggerated promises to induce the placebo effect."
      },
      "1": {
        "text": "B. By encouraging you to research and verify their product claims",
        "explanation": "Choice B is incorrect. Scammers typically discourage verification to keep their false claims from being exposed."

        "text": "C. By claiming their products have immediate and miraculous effects",
