        "text": "A. Ask them to provide their social media profile information.",
        "explanation": "Choice A is incorrect. Knowing the unknown caller’s social media profile information cannot verify the caller’s identity as the social media profile itself can be fake as well."
      },
      "1": {
        "text": "B. Share personal information about your family to confirm their identity.",
        "explanation": "Choice B is incorrect. Do not share any of your or your family's personal information with the caller. Doing so will only provide more information to the scammer, which could be used against you."

        "text": "C. Contact your grandchild or their parents through a known method to confirm they called you.",
        "explanation": "Choice C is correct. This strategy allows you to bypass the potentially spoofed phone number and contact your grandchild or their parents directly through a separate verified method (like their known personal phone number, email, etc.). Also,  you can double-check if your grandchild genuinely tried to call you and was truly in need of help as the caller claimed. Therefore, do not take any action until you have confirmed the caller's identity with a separate method."

        "text": "A. Feel happy and provide your grandchild's name, assuming they want you to guess it.",
        "explanation": "Choice A is incorrect. It's understandable to feel happy when receiving a call from a grandchild. However, if they address you generically, it's safer to have them state their name first. Given the prevalence of grandparent scams, instruct your grandchildren to proactively identify themselves when calling, instead of prompting you to guess their name. Therefore, if someone asks you to guess their identity, it should raise an alert."

        "text": "C. If they respond as “your favorite grandson/granddaughter” without stating their name, wait for them to provide it themselves",
        "explanation": "Choice C is correct. The caller first used a generic greeting, and If you ask their name and they still don’t give it, responding something like “I am your favorite grandson”, or asking you to guess, do not give any names! This is a major red flag of a grandparent scam."

        "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Using a secret codeword or question is an efficient way to verify the caller’s identity. Even with plenty of your personal information, it is highly unlikely the scammers would know your secret word or the answers to a specific question known only to your grandchild. If you don’t have one yet, create one now."

    "choices": {
      "0": {
        "text": "A. Ask for their identification number",

        "explanation": "Choice B is incorrect. Blindly following the caller's request, even if they claim to be a police officer, can be extremely risky.

Also, do not use the number provided by the caller; instead, find the official number from a reliable source such as their official website. Contacting the police department directly is a reliable method."

They can not only help you confirm whether the caller's claim is true or a scam, but also help you avoid making impulsive decisions in response to a potentially urgent or distressing situation."
