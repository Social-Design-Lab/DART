Common stories they use include fabricated car accidents, being falsely arrested in a foreign country, experiencing a medical crisis, or being kidnapped while traveling abroad. If you receive a call with such a frightening and urgent story, it's likely a scam. On the other hand, having a party with friends is not an emergency or fear-inducing situation, so it is usually not a part of scammers' deceptive stories."
