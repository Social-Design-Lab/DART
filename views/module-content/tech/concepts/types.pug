                            p A Pop-Up warning is a window or message that suddenly appears on your device’s screen, claiming that your device has been infected or has a security issue and you need to call the indicated number to fix it. The message may look like it is coming from your antivirus software or your operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows, macOS) by using their logos and other branding information. [3]

                            //- p Once they have determined who to target, they will gather information about the target’s family, relationships, and other personal information.

                            p Scammers try to reach their victims by making their FAKE “tech support” websites appear in internet search results. They pay for online advertisements to promote their fake services. Search engines, like Google, place ads before the list of search results, making it more likely that people will click the ad. If you are searching for reputable tech support companies, be sure you scroll past the ads.


                            //- p In this step, scammers come up with a plan: the role they'll play, the story they'll tell, and the tools they'll use. They fabricate an emergency situation based on the gathered information to evoke fear and urgency from the target [2].
