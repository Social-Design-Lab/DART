                    p The scammer may claim these untraceable payment methods allow for faster transfers than checks. However, this excuse creates a false sense of urgency to pressure you into sending money quickly.

                    p Scammer (female voice): I'm at the store, Grandpa. They have the phone I need, but I can't pay for it.
                    p Grandparent: Don't worry, I'll help you. What do I need to do?
                    p Scammer: Grandpa, I need you to buy a gift card for me. Can you do it?
                    p Grandparent: A gift card? Why?
                    p Scammer: Yes, Grandpa. Buy an iTunes gift card for $500. I'll use it to purchase the phone online.
                    p Grandparent: Alright, I'll try. How do I do that?
                    p Scammer: Just go to the store and ask for an iTunes gift card. Once you have it, scratch off the back to reveal the code, and then text me the code. I'll take care of the rest.
