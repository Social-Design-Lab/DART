                            p This is a very cunning scheme. The scammers are aware that banks and money transfer services ask about the purpose when someone wants to withdraw or transfer a large amount of money. They take advantage of grandparents' worries that their grandchild may get a criminal record. By playing on this fear, the scammers persuade the grandparents not to reveal the real reason for the money transaction. So, DO NOT BELIEVE THEM!

Just tell them that it is a gift or even a birthday present.
