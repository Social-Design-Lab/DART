                                li.speaker1(data-timecode="00:18") Grandparent: He told me he was okay
                                li.speaker2(data-timecode="00:20") Scammer: Yeah he is, I mean he has a fractured nose. The lady in the other vehicle got injured, and she was released from the hospital which is obviously good news. Now, when the authorities arrive on an accident scene, they perform what is called a breathalyzer test, that he failed. Jimmy had an alcohol content of .10. The legal limit is .08.
                                li.speaker1(data-timecode="00:38") Grandparent: He was drinking and driving?
                                li.speaker2(data-timecode="00:39") Scammer: Yes. But I spoke to the judge handling the matter. Because Jimmy has a clean record, if we are able to post his bond, the judge will dismiss his reckless endangerment charge.
