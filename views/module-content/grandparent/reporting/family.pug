                    p Scammers may know the name of your family member, such as your grandchild, but they likely lack specific details about them or other relatives. 

                    p Therefore, be alert if they say something inaccurate about your family members. It is a big red flag!! They may try to excuse the mistake by claiming they misremembered or misspoke. Verify the information later with someone you trust.
