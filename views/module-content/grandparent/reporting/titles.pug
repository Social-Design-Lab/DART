                    p Be alert if you answer the phone and hear 'Grandma' or 'Grandpa' instead of being addressed by your name or a personal nickname. This generic greeting could be a red flag, especially if it's not how your grandchild would normally address you.


                    p  Do not give any names; wait the caller to speak their own name, or else you may inadvertently provide your grandchildâ€™s name to the scammers.
