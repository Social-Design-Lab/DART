                p Rachel refused to send more money. Alex is now upset and is trying to guilt her into sending more money.
                //- p Rachel told you that she and Alex had a great conversion that day, and they began to talk everyday since then. Rachel told you that she was the happiest she's ever been during the first two weeks of talking with Alex.
                //- p For the last month, Alex texted her morning and night, showing a lot of care in different ways. For example, Alex checked Rachel’s local weather and reminded her to take an umbrella. Rachel emphasized that she has never felt this loved, understood, and respected. She feels like they are a perfect match for each other.
