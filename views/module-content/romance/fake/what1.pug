                            | Spotting Fake Profiles
                    p Romance & friendship scams begin with the creation of a fake profile. The scammers build a false persona to persuade the victim theyâ€™re an authority or likable person, increasing trust.
                        | The median reported loss was $4,400. Romance Scams increased during the pandemic while people struggled emotionally.
                    p When encountering a profile, exercise caution if it appears incomplete, or if the individual excuses this by claiming forgetfulness or a lack of time. Genuine profiles typically show <strong>regular interactions</strong>, such as comments and likes from friends, and are connected to other social media accounts. A lack of these interactions could indicate the profile isn't real. Moreover, the use of a <strong>conventionally attractive profile</strong> photo could be a calculated move to lure you in.
