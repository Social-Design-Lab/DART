                        //-     | To add a sense of urgency to their requests, scammers often use specific words and phrases like “please” or “quickly help me.” They may also threaten to harm themselves or others. This tactic is designed to make you feel under pressure, pushing you to act swiftly, often leading to decisions without proper consideration, such as sending money immediately. Additionally, scammers might use guilt to their advantage. By sending gifts or doing small favors, they create a scenario where you might feel indebted, believing you need to reciprocate their generosity, further manipulating your emotions to their benefit.

These threats are designed to create fear and anxiety, compelling you to comply with their demands to avoid the consequences. It's crucial to never share intimate details or images, such as nude photographs, with strangers online. Once scammers have this material, they can use it to coerce you into giving them money or other favors under the threat of exposure.
