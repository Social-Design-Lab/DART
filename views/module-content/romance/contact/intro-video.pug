            p INT. DART OFFICE - DAY. Split Screen between the DART Agent and media on the other half of the screen showing a text chat/phone screen cap of a scam. Narrator/DART Agent (Informative) speaks over text conversation visuals.
            p Romance scammers build relationships quickly, often complimenting and flattering. Text conversation: Heidi Mylie says, "Hey there, couldnâ€™t help but notice your profile, and I must say, you have the most captivating smile. It instantly brightened my day." ðŸ˜€ (You) "Thank you! Thatâ€™s so sweet of you to say." Heidi Mylie responds, "Sweet is an understatement. Iâ€™m genuinely amazed by your beauty and your kindness radiates through your words. Itâ€™s rare to find someone as stunning and genuine as you on here."
            p Text shows the target can't talk on the phone or video chat with excuses. Heidi Mylie: "Iâ€™d love to see your beautiful face and hear your voice, but my camera and microphone are broken. Planning to fix them soon." (You) "Oh, thatâ€™s too bad. Looking forward to video chatting." Heidi Mylie: "I promise, as soon as I'm sorted, weâ€™ll have amazing video calls. Canâ€™t wait for that day!"
            p Scammers eventually ask for money for emergencies. Text conversation: Heidi Mylie: "Was on my way to visit a sick relative, and my car broke down. Itâ€™s late, and Iâ€™m stuck without enough money for a tow or repairs." (You) "That sounds awful! How can I help?" Heidi Mylie: "If you could lend me money for the tow and repairs, Iâ€™d pay you back as soon as I can. Donâ€™t want to be stranded all night."
            p Warning: Never give money to people you donâ€™t know online, especially under pressure! Heidi Mylie: "I canâ€™t believe youâ€™re not willing to help me. I thought we had something special." (You) "Iâ€™m sorry, but I canâ€™t send money to someone Iâ€™ve never met in person. Itâ€™s not safe." Heidi Mylie concludes, "Forget it! Youâ€™re just like all the others, heartless and selfish. I canâ€™t believe I wasted my time on you."
