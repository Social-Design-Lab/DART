                    p I'd like to emphasize two essential suggestions. 
                    p First, as discussed in Chapter 2, emotional manipulation is a widely used technique among romance scammers. Therefore, do NOT feel obligated, guilty, or sad when refusing to give money or help transfer money for someone you've only met online.
                    p Second, Romance Scams can be emotionally difficult. Donâ€™t be afraid to talk to a professional counselor.
