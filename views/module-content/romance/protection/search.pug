                p Copying a suspicious message and pasting it into a search engine to see if others have received it and identified it as a scam can help you protect yourself from romance and friendship scams. This practice helps protect you by providing context and warning signs from other potential victims. If the message is indeed a scam, search results may reveal warnings, reports, or discussions about similar fraudulent activities, allowing you to recognize the scam and avoid falling victim to it.
