        | Instead of creating a romantic relationship, the scammer will 
        | pretend to have your same likes and interests to quickly form a 
        | friendship with you. Once the scammer feels you care for them, they 
        | will ask you for money or personal information to help pay 
        | their bills or other financial hardships.Â
