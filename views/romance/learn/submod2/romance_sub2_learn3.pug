      p Here are some questions to ask yourself regarding the content of the message received:
      ul 
        li Is the user's story consistent and realistic? Are all the details matching up and making sense?
        li Is the user saying that they live far away from you?
        li Is the user asking for favors almost immediately?
        li Is the user asking for your personal information, such as credit card number or address?
        li Is the user love-bombing and/or guilt tripping you?
