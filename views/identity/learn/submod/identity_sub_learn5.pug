              | Well done! You've learned two important concepts: 
              strong Identity theft, 
              | which occurs when someone steals your personal identifiable information and exploits it for malicious purposes, and 
              strong personal identifiable information, 
              | which is the information uniquely associated with you, which can be directly or indirectly used to identify you.
              br
              br
              | Moreover, you have gained insight into the severe consequences that can arise when someone steals your identity.
              br

              | Now, let's put our newfound knowledge into practice and reinforce what we've learned!
